# Vision Transformers for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation

This work was originally developed by Miguel Gonçalves in the context of an M.Sc. thesis project at Instituto Superior Técnico of the University of Lisbon. The project aimed to further explore the use of general-purpose Vision Transformer models (i.e., ) for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery, comparing the obtained results with current domain-specific approaches.

# Vision Transformers for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation

This work was developed by Miguel Gonçalves in the context of an M.Sc. dissertation at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. It aimed to further explore the use of general-purpose Vision Transformer models for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery, comparing obtained results with current domain-specific approaches.

This repository is intended to make the code used in this research work publicly available for reproducibility purposes, however, it is still a work-in-progress. More detailed instructions will be published soon.
